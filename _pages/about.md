Hello World.

I'm a Cloudnative Human. I also like to do stuff in the real world, including give talks and workshops on cloudnative things. I also happen to be an experience studio and event photographer and have travelled the weird and wonderful places in the world doing just that!

Follow me on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/ashikm) 
Check out my [art and photos](https://lovejam.ca)
Check out any workshops I may be running at [Aptum.com/events](https://aptum.com/events/)
I also have an instagram...but you have to know me personally and if you know you know :)
